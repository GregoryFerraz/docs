 **About this Documentation**
*****************************
This documentation is an effort of `BPA Technologies <https://bpatechnologies.com/>`_ (``https://bpatechnologies.com/``) , a RPA company based in SÃ£o Paulo, it is currently being mantained by the former. Thanks to **Allan Zimmermann**, creator, mantainer and founder of `**OpenRPA** <http://openiap.io>`_  (``http://openiap.io``), and his cooperation in providing the necessary resources we were able to make this manual happen. We'd also like to thank **Thiago Pestitschek** for his cheerful and promising ideas for the documentation as well as assisting in proof-reading and writing this manual and **Paulo Veras** for helping to write and mantain this documentation.

Here the reader will find useful information on how to use OpenRPA, OpenFlow and Node-RED in order to develop useful RPA workflows which accomplish the execution of business processes. Although not strictly needed, the user should have some previous experience with RPA concepts and usage.

The 1st chapter is a brief and friendly introduction to what RPA actually is and our choices for using specifically this stack. The 2nd chapter is an in-depth exploration of the orchestration framework used, namely OpenFlow.  The 3rd chapter is a guided tour on the functionalities of OpenRPA - the tool where the actual automation happens. Finally, the 4th chapter is an overview of Node-RED functionalities in respect to RPA automation.
