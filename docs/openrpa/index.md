# What is RPA?
RPA or Robotic Process Automation are software base solutions designed to mimic the same "manual" path taken through applications by an end user. It is typically used to automate repetitive tasks previously performed by a humans as an effective way to cut costs, eliminate keying errors, speed up processes and easily link applications together. These tasks can be successfully modeled and converted into a business process and then automated using a combination of (UI) interactions, connectors to client servers, mainframes, database, web, and others.

# OpenRPA
This tool is basically the main environment where the processes are mapped and designed to fulfill the inherent task at question. Think of it as an `IDE - Integrated Development Environment` for creating workflows. It is where all previously mapped activities will be implemented - such as clicking a message on a mailbox, typing content into an input form.

# LowCode
Low code concept means there is no technical or programing knowledge required to perform a desired task, i.e. you can simply just drag a box and input a few parameters for it to become fully functional.

The term `low code` refers to platforms that resort mainly to GUI-focused interfaces which assist users in the development of a BPM without necessarily requiring basic programming knowledge. These applications use heavy visual modeling in favor of coding to aid in the process of designing and implementing processes.

Low code development platforms have a very gentle learning curve and are often designed with UX-oriented practices in mind. It is a fact that it also helps the user to advance rapidly and design and deploy working processes with few caveats.
