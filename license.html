<p><strong>5.1.</strong> The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated <strong>(a)</strong> provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and <strong>(b)</strong> on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p><strong>5.2.</strong> If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
<p><strong>5.3.</strong> In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.6. </span>Disclaimer of Warranty<a class="headerlink" href="#disclaimer-of-warranty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.7. </span>Limitation of Liability<a class="headerlink" href="#limitation-of-liability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
limitation may not apply to You.</p>

<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
