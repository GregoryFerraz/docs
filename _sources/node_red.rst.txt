What is Node-RED?
=================

**Node-RED** is a programming tool used for linking all our tools together (**OpenRPA** and **OpenFlow**) as well as hardware devices, APIs and even online services in a new and interesting way. Think of it as a "backend" process flow designer & integrator. The communication between **Node-RED** and **OON stack** is done through MQTT protocol (powered by RabbitMQ).

It provides an in-browser editor where you can connect flows using any nodes available. Each node represents a step that when wired together forms a meaningful task. It also follows a common pattern: input, processing and output. It is important to note that **Node-RED** functions like a middleware to an information processing system. It simply connects the inputs to the workflows and allows them to process it.

What is MQTT?
-------------
MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices with low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks. The design principle is to minimise network bandwidth and device resource requirements while attempting to ensure reliability and assurance of delivery. These principles in turn make the protocol ideal for the emerging “machine-to-machine” (M2M) or “Internet of Things” world of connected devices, and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are limited.


*********************************
 **Accessing for the first time**
*********************************
To access Node-RED, simply use a browser and go to your **Node-RED** environment URL. If running local, default is http://localhost.openrpa.dk:1880 and OpenIAP demo is https://demo.app.openiap.io.

Once there, a button is shown with the text ``Sign in with SAML``. When you click the button, Node-RED attempts to gather your currently (or cached) logged in **OpenFlow** authentication data and then logs in, to **Node-RED**, with the same user.

 **Node-RED Editor**
********************
The editor window is where all the work gets done. It contains four components: header, palette, workspace and sidebar.

   Node-RED Components.

Header
======
The header contains the deploy button, main menu, and, if user authentication is activated, the user menu.

Deploy Button
-------------
The deploy button is used to deploy flows once you have finished creating or editing them. It is important to remark that you must always deploy a flow after editing it so the changes are applied.

Main Menu
---------
The main menu contains many actions, such as hiding components, importing or exporting flows, searching for flows, actions (like add, rename and delete) flows and subflows, manage palettes, settings, keyboard shortcuts and a link to Node-RED's webpage.

User Menu
---------
The user menu, if the user is authenticated, shows your username and the option to logout.

Palette
=======
The palette contains all of the nodes that are installed and available to use. These nodes are organized into a number of categories, which can be expanded or collapsed by clicking its header.

The entire palette can be hidden by clicking the toggle button that is shown when the mouse is over it or by pressing **Ctrl+p**.¹

Workspace
=========
The main workspace is where flows are developed by dragging nodes from the palette and wiring them together.

The workspace has a row of tabs along the top; one for each flow and any subflows that have been opened. ²

   Node-RED Editor Workspace.

View Tools
----------
The footer of the workspace contains buttons to zoom in and out as well as to reset the default zoom level. It also contains a toggle button for the view navigator.

To zoom in, either click the **+** button inside the view navigator or press **Ctrl+=**.

To zoom out, either click the **-** button inside the view navigator or press **Ctrl+-**.

To reset the zoom, either click the **O** button inside the view navigator or press **Ctrl+0**.

The view navigator provides a scaled down view of the entire workspace, highlighting the area currently visible. That area can be dragged around the navigator to quickly jump to other parts of the workspace. It is also useful for finding nodes that have been **lost** to the further edges of the workspace.

Customising the view
---------------------
The workspace view can be customised via the **View** tab of the User Settings dialog.

To activate the User Settings dialog, press **Ctrl+,**.

Sidebar
=======
The sidebar contains panels that provide a number of useful tools within the editor.³

- **Information**

	View information about nodes and their help info

- **Debug**

	View messages passed into debug nodes

- **Configuration Nodes**

	Manage configuration nodes

- **Context Data**

	View the contents of the context variables

   Node-RED Editor Sidebar.

Some nodes contribute their own sidebar panels, such as `node-red-dashboard <https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard/>`_ (https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard).

The panels are opened by clicking their icon in the header of the sidebar, or by selecting them in the drop-down list shown.

The sidebar can be resized by dragging tis edge across the workspace.

If the edge is dragged close to the right-hand edge, the sidebar will be hidden. It can be shown again by selecting the **Show sidebar** option in the View menu, or using the **Ctrl+Space** shortcut.
