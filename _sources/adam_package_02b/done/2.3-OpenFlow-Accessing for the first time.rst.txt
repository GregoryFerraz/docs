 **Accessing for the first time**
*********************************

To access **OpenFlow** webpage, simply go to the URL as specified by your working enviroment (contact your IT responsible, if needed). If running a local version, by default the URL should be ``http://localhost.openrpa.dk``.

If you do not have access to an **OpenFlow** of you own and you are not running a local version, we encourage you to do some experimentation using our own demo enviroment, which can be found at ``https://app.openiap.io``.

After accessing the page, users are prompted to authenticate themselves. After signing in, the user is redirected to the home page of **OpenFlow**.

.. note ::
   If you are accessing OpenFlow demo enviroment (``https://app.openiap.io``), when prompted for credentials, you may type any username/password combination and your user will be then created automatically with the same credentials. Please keep note of your username/password!
