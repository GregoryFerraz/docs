 **What is OpenFlow?** 
**********************

**OpenFlow** is the heart of the *OON* stack, orchestrating all the activities between the applications. Here lies some of its major features:

* Managing, invoking and configuring your robots and workflows;
* Managing users and their permissions levels;
* Creating forms whenever a human must participate in a process and viewing all currently assigned or idle workflows pending to the user;
* Managing MongoDB collections and entries;
* A central cloud repository, allowing its content (workflows, forms, files in MongoDB, ...) to be available to the robots, users and other applications with ease.
