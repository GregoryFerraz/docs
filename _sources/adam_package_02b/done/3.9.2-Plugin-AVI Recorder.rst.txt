AVI Recorder
============
The AVI Recorder is used to unattended record the execution of a workflow. This plugin is extremely useful when debugging a workflow that is occasionally failing and it is hard to closely watch the execution as it is happening.

In the **Settings** tab inside **OpenRPA** ribbon, click **Run Plugins**. Then select ``AviRecorder``, mark the ``Enabled`` checkbox and set the desired ``Saved folder`` path where the recordings will be saved.

By default, **OpenRPA** will only keep recordings of workflow executions that failed - either naturally because the process itself failed or forced by a Throw Activity. If it is desired to record all executions instead - successful and failed ones -, mark the ``Keep successful`` checkbox.

Additionaly, the ``Codec`` and ``Recording quality`` can be adjusted to save harddrive space or to increase the recording quality.
