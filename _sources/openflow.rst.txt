 **OpenFlow** 
=============

.. 2.1.
**********************
 **What is OpenFlow?** 
**********************

**OpenFlow** is the heart of the *OON* stack, orchestrating all the activities between the applications. Here lies some of its major features:

* Managing, invoking and configuring your robots and workflows;
* Managing users and their permissions levels;
* Creating forms whenever a human must participate in a process and viewing all currently assigned or idle workflows pending to the user;
* Managing MongoDB collections and entries;
* A central cloud repository, allowing its content (workflows, forms, files in MongoDB, ...) to be available to the robots, users and other applications with ease. 

.. 2.2.
**************************
 **Installing, First Run**
**************************
This section's purpose is to help the user install an **OpenFlow** instance **locally**. If you already have an **OpenFlow** URL provided, you may skip this step.

In order to proceed with the local installation, the following are required:

* `NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ (``https://nodejs.org/en/``) - preferably using `nvm <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>`_ (``https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm``)
* `MongoDB Community Server <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community>`_ (``https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community``)
* `RabbitMQ <https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html>`_ (``https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html``).

.. 2.2.1
Quickstart Running OpenFlow using NPM
=====================================
In this section lies a brief and concise description of how to install **OpenFlow** through NPM.

Then, the user must run the following command from a command prompt with escalated privileges ("Run as administrator") in Windows 10.

.. code-block:: powershell

   npm install --global windows-built-tools


If using any GNU/Linux distro which uses the ``APT`` package manager, the following command replaces the one above.

.. code-block:: powershell

   sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make

Then, the user must install the ``openiap`` package.

.. code-block:: powershell

   npm i openiap -g

Then, the user shall create a template configuration file.

.. code-block:: powershell

   openflow-cli --init


Now the user can install the service.

.. code-block:: powershell

   openflow-cli --install openflow

In order to access **OpenFlow**, all that is left to do is access the `OpenFlow page <http://localhost.openrpa.dk>`_ (``http://localhost.openrpa.dk``).

.. 2.2.2.
Developer Setup
===============
If you have interest in creating a developer setup in order to develop some extra features yourself or to debug, in this section you will find a brief and concise description of how to install **OpenFlow** by cloning `OpenFlow's GitHub Repository <https://github.com/open-rpa/openflow>`_ (``https://github.com/open-rpa/openflow``) and running it in **Visual Studio Code**.

Obviously, `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_ (``https://code.visualstudio.com/download``) is required.

First, the user must clone the repository.

.. code-block:: powershell

   git clone https://github.com/open-rpa/openflow

Then, the user must initialize a command prompt and redirect it to the directory.

.. code-block:: powershell

   cd openflow

Now the user must install ``gulp`` and ``typescript`` globally.

.. code-block:: powershell

   npm i gulp typescript browserify tsify -gather

And also install the packages mentioned in ``packages.json`` for the project.

.. code-block:: powershell

   npm i

Now the user must do the same for the packages required by **Node-RED**.

.. code-block:: powershell

   cd openflow_node_red_configure_form
   npm i
   cd ..

Now the user will open the working folder in VS Code.

.. code-block:: powershell

   code OpenFlow.code-workspace

And create a folder called ``config`` at the top level of the **OpenFlow** folder. Inside it create a file called ``.env`` - be careful, notice that the file's name starts with a dot!

Lastly, the user shall add the following content to the ``.env`` file:

.. code-block:: powershell

   nodered_id=nodered1
   nodered_sa=nodered1
   port=80
   nodered_port=1880
   nodered_domain_schema=$nodered_id$.localhost.openrpa.dk
   tls_crt=
   tls_key=
   tls_ca=

If using **Windows 10**, allow Powershell Scripts to run by changing the Execution Policy using the following command in a Powershell Prompt with escalated privileges.

.. code-block:: powershell

   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass --Force

Finally, run ``OpenFlow`` by pressing ``Ctrl+Shift+D``, selecting ``OpenFlow`` in the dropdown box and clicking the **Play** button.

The user may now access **OpenFlow** by using a browser and navigating to the default URL, which is ``http://localhost.openrpa.dk`` if unchanged.

To properly install and configure **Node-RED**, please refer to the **Installing & First Run** section in the **Node-RED** chapter.

*********************************
 **Accessing for the first time**
*********************************

To access **OpenFlow** webpage, simply go to the URL as specified by your working enviroment (contact your IT responsible, if needed). If running a local version, by default the URL should be ``http://localhost.openrpa.dk``.

If you do not have access to an **OpenFlow** of you own and you are not running a local version, we encourage you to do some experimentation using our own demo enviroment, which can be found at ``https://app.openiap.io``.

After accessing the page, users are prompted to authenticate themselves. After signing in, the user is redirected to the home page of **OpenFlow**.

.. note ::
   If you are accessing OpenFlow demo enviroment (``https://app.openiap.io``), when prompted for credentials, you may type any username/password combination and your user will be then created automatically with the same credentials. Please keep note of your username/password!

.. 2.5.
**********
 **Roles**
**********
Here is explained what **Roles** in OpenFlow are and how they interfere with **OpenRPA** and **Node-RED** access privileges.

What are Roles?
===============
In **OpenFlow**, Roles are an unit or collection of privileges and permissions that can be assigned to one or more users or to a group of users. These Roles serve various purposes, such as granting access to projects/workflows inside **OpenRPA** or granting access to specific flows inside **Node-RED**.

Remember that both human users and robots are called ``users`` in **OpenFlow** and Roles work the same way for both.

RPARole (Pool)
==============
Sometimes it may desired to create a Pool of ``users``, e.g. "Buyers", so that many ``users`` (buyer_John, buyer_Maria, buyer_robot1, ...) can be inserted in this Pool. By doing so, it will become easier to manage previleges and accesses when compared to manually adjusting each ``user``'s Roles.

RPARole also allows workflows or Node-RED flows to assign a task to the "Buyers" Pool instead of a specific ``user``. This way, when a workflow can be assigned to any ``user`` from a Pool, the framework will automatically assign the task to the first available listening ``user``.

Therefore, **RPARole** is a parameter set in the Role editting page of a role which enables a Role to become a Pool of users instead.

If set, all ``users`` added to the Role start listening to the Role-Queue ``id``, i.e., ``users`` now become consumers to the Queue belonging to this Role. When an ``user`` logs in, they listen natively to their own User-Queue ``id``; Additionaly, for each Role with the parameter RPARole that this user is memberof, the user will also start listening to Role-Queue ``id``. See more at `pool <https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/86372>`_ (``https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/86372``).

But what is a consumer?
-----------------------

   *The term "consumer" means different things in different contexts. In general in messaging a consumer is an application (or application instance) that consumes messages. The same application can also publish messages and thus be a publisher at the same time. In this sense a consumer is a subscription for message delivery that has to be registered before deliveries begin and can be cancelled by the application*.

   *RabbitMQ is a messaging broker. It accepts messages from publishers, routes them and, if there were queues to route to, stores them for consumption or immediately delivers to consumers, if any. Consumers consume from queues. In order to consume messages there has to be a queue. When a new consumer is added, assuming there are already messages ready in the queue, deliveries will start immediately. The target queue can be empty at the time of consumer registration. In that case first deliveries will happen when new messages are enqueued*.¹

¹ - `Consumers <https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html>`_ (``https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumers.html``)

.. 2.5.3.
Granting permissions (admin, nodered, user)
===========================================
Changing permissions in **OpenFlow** is very easy. 

In order to change roles, the user must be an ``Admin``, i.e., be assigned to the ``admins`` role.

Then, the user must click the ``Admin`` dropdown inside **OpenFlow**'s webpage.

.. figure:: images/chap_openflow_roles/openflow_roles_click_roles_dropdown.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

All you need to do now is go to the **Roles** page inside OpenFlow's page and click the ``Pencil/Edit`` icon corresponding to the Role which you want to add users to. As an example, we're going to change the ``personal nodered users`` Role.

.. figure:: images/chap_openflow_roles/openflow_roles_edit_personal_nodered_users_role.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

After clicking the ``Pencil/Edit`` icon, the user is redirected to the **Role** page, which contains the ``Name`` of the role, the ``rparole`` checkbox, the ``add`` input field and the ``member`` list, as seen below. To add a new ``user``/``Role`` to that Role, simply insert the name of this ``user``/``Role`` in the ``add`` input field. A dropdown list will then appear and the user chooses which ``user``/``Role`` it is desired to be added to the Role.

.. figure:: images/chap_openflow_roles/openflow_roles_add_user.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

After selecting the desired values, the **add** button will become clickable. After clicking it, the recently selected ``user/Role`` will be added to the ``member`` list. Remember to **Save** the changes, otherwise they will not take place.

.. figure:: images/chap_openflow_roles/openflow_roles_click_save_button.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 50%

Node-RED permissions
--------------------
Everytime a ``Workflow In`` node is set with a ``Queue name`` and the flow to which it belongs to is deployed inside **Node-RED**, a new Role is created inside the **Roles** page with the prefix of the subdomain for the **Node-RED** (default: "nodered1"), the middle part is the name of the queue (as defined inside the node properties) and the suffix is "users". E.g.: "nodered1google-vision-apiusers".

.. note::

   When logged in as a non-``Admin`` user, to have access and invoke that workflow inside the **Workflows** page, the user must be added to that Role!

List of Main Roles inside OpenFlow
----------------------------------
Here are the main Roles inside **OpenFlow** and their permissions.

* **filestore users** - members of this Role can see all files uploaded to **OpenFlow**.
* **filestore admins** - members of this Role have full control (delete, update, ...) on all files uploaded to OpenFlow.
* **robot users** - currently unused, supposed to represent all robots.
* **robot admins** - currently unused, members from this role have full control (delete, update, ...) on all objects related to robots.
* **personal nodered users** - members of this Role can create new **Node-RED** instances, if **OpenFlow** is running on Kubernetes.
* **nodered users** - members from this Role have read-only access to all Node-RED instances.
* **nodered admins** - members from this Role have full access to all Node-RED instances.
* **nodered api users** - members from this Role can call APIs exposed from all Node-RED instances, when ``api_allow_anonymous`` is set to ``true``.
* **users** - All users are members of this Role.
* **admins** - Members from this role have access to everything inside the system. At the moment, ``admins`` can do everything the ``root`` user is able to do.

.. 2.6.
*****************************
 **Workflows Tab (Node-RED)**
*****************************

What is it?
===========
Workflows in Node-RED are mainly called '**Flows**'. These flows are made to connect different services, applications and logic functions. When grouped together they can be used to process data and output the results to a given service or file. 

At the  `Workflows page <http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Workflows>`_ (eg. ``http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Workflows``) in OpenFlow, it is possible to remotely invoke these flows.

.. figure:: images/openflow_node_red_subflow.png
   :align: center

   **Node-RED subflow example.**


Invoking
========
Workflows can be started through all three applications: OpenRPA, OpenFlow and Node-RED. Invoking a workflow does not change it's content, it merely executes it remotely. Think of it as a read-only procedure.

- **Deploying a Workflow to Node-RED**

   Upon accessing Node-RED, flow tabs are shown containing all the flows available for deployment. To execute a Node-RED flow, simply click the starting node inside a Node-RED subflow. Everytime a change is made to a Node-RED flow or subflow it is required to deploy it again so the changes are applied.

   If it is desired to invoke a workflow through OpenFlow according to the settings set on the Node-RED application, a few more steps are required.

   1. Enter the Node-RED page and select the desired flow tab where you want to create the subflow containing the invoke call to OpenFlow.
   2. Create a subflow with a ``Workflow In`` node as its starting point.
   3. Click twice the ``Workflow In`` node corresponding to the workflow you want to create.
   4. Name it by setting up the ``Queue name`` input field.
   5. If desired, route it to send a form back to the user by using ``Workflow Out``  (more about Forms below).
   6. Check one or both of the checkboxes: RPA - to enable this node to be invoked from OpenRPA - and WEB - to enable invoking from OpenFlow.
   7. Deploy the current flow.

   It is important to remark that when a ``Workflow In`` node is deployed, it will create a corresponding role inside OpenFlow named "nodered$<``Queue name``>", and only users that are members of this role can invoke this workflow. On the following next steps, if you can't see your workflow when attempting to remotely invoke it, double check and see if your user is a member of that role!

.. note::
   The user must have the ``nodered users`` role enabled in order to able to invoke Node-RED flows from within OpenFlow.

.. figure:: images/openflow_setting_nodered_workflow.png
   :align: center

   **Enabling Node-RED invoking from OpenFlow.**

-  **Invoking a Node-RED workflow in OpenFlow**

   After the steps above are complete, go to the `Workflows page <http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Workflows>`_ (eg. ``http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Workflows``) and directly invoke the desired workflow. A form page will then open to choose the input parameters, if any.

   The forms are either automatically generated by OpenRPA, according to the variables preset - more on that on OpenRPA's Variables section - or manually generated by the user on the `Forms page <http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Forms>`_ (eg. ``http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Forms``).

   Upon clicking submit on a form, the parameters are sent to the robot for processing and execution of the given workflow.

.. figure:: images/openflow_workflows_page.png

      **Workflows page.**

.. figure:: images/openflow_form_example.png

      **Form example.**


********************************
 **RPA Workflows Tab (OpenRPA)**
********************************

What is it?
===========
Workflows in OpenRPA and OpenFlow are the same thing, an algorithm or a sequence of steps that execute a meaningful task. The difference is that when you invoke a workflow in OpenFlow, it creates an instance of that workflow. By accessing the Workflows tab, you may invoke workflows remotely, meaning, the stack in OpenFlow will send a message to the available agent to process and execute the given workflow.

From OpenFlow you can create forms, grant permissions to a given workflow and most importantly invoke it.

OpenFlow automatically manages the workflow repository. When properly connected, by saving a workflow inside OpenRPA, it will also automatically appear inside the Workflows webpage.

To download a workflow, simply go to the RPA Workflows link and click download. After dowloading the .XAML file, you may share it with others or import it into your OpenRPA client.

Invoking
========

- **Methods for Invoking**
	
   Here we discuss the methods for invoking a workflow using OpenFlow.

- **Invoking through OpenFlow's RPA Workflows Page**

   To invoke a workflow through OpenFlow, simply go to `RPA Workflows page <http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/RPAWorkflows>`_ (eg. http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Workflows) and click Invoke, another page for the specific workflow will be opened where all the forms needed to be filled are going to be presented. Simply fill them and click Invoke again. The input data is then sent to the chosen robot/agent and it will start processing the workflow.

   Data processing is bi-directional: input parameters are sent to a robot/agent and the workflow output will also be returned. That means that you can make many workflows calling different applications. Think of it as a message, messages are sent, read and replied to. Nothing prevents that message from being sent, read or replied to multiple times.

.. note::
   For the user to invoke a workflow using OpenFlow, the user must have the proper permissions. See more at OpenRPA's chapter Granting permissions to users/roles.

**********
 **Forms**
**********

Forms are an user-friendly way of passing input to a workflow by creating dynamic OpenFlow's webpages. There are two ways of generating a form, one of them is through OpenFlow's automatically generated forms which are created upon saving a Workflow into its repository and the other one is manually creating a form and connecting it to a Node-RED workflow.


Creating a Form
===============

Creating a form is rather easy and simple. Go to the Forms page, where all forms are listed, available under the Admin dropdown or on the `Forms page <http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Forms>`_ (eg. http://localhost.openrpa.dk/#/Forms) and click the Navy blue ``Add form`` button.

Now at the Forms edit page, there are many basic from which you can choose. For synthetic purposes, we are only going to discuss the most used one here: Text Field Component. 

Drag the Form from the Basic category into the Form workspace. Immediately after, a window containing all the parameters to configure the form will appear.

Configuring the Form
====================
Below are the steps needed to properly configure a form, in our case TextField Form.

- **Changing Form Label**

   To change the Form's label, ie. the title which will appear for the end-user, simply click the Display tab and change the input form titled **Label**, the changes are shown real-time.

- **Assigning Input Variable**

   To assign the input form to a variable configured inside the OpenRPA workflow you've mapped to OpenFlow, simply go to the API tab and insert the name of the variable inside **Property Name** and press save. Now the next time this workflow is called, a new parameter will appear.

- **Assigning Form to Node-RED Workflow**

   Now it is required that you assign a Form to a Node-RED workflow. To do that, go to Node-RED and click twice on the ``Workflow Out`` node you want to assign the form to. The ``Edit workflow out node`` tab appears and you must select the form you've just created in the ``Userform`` dropdown.
