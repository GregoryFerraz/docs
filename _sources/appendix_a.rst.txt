 **Appendix A** 
===============

This appendix deals with questions concerning programming concepts often needed to understand OpenRPA.

*****************
 **Introduction**
*****************

What is hardware?
=================
By using the term **hardware**, we mean the physical parts that constitute a computer - the motherboard, CPU, GPU, etc. That is, the ``hard`` part of a computer, which is touchable and immediately visible in the physical realm.

What is software?
=================
From **software**, when we refer to it generally, ie. ``lato sensu``, we mean the concept of the abstract parts which constitute a computer - the programs which comprise all the computable abstractions performable by a computer. When we refer to it specifically, ie. ``stricto sensu``, we refer to one of these programs. **OpenRPA, OpenFlow and Node-RED** are software themselves.

What is a programming language?
===============================
A programming language is a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax used to create a software program. Languages that programmers use to write code are called "high-level languages." This code can be compiled into a "low-level language," which is recognized directly by computer hardware.ยน **OpenRPA** itself is developed and maintained in a programming language called **C# - read "see sharp"**.

ยน - `TechTerms - Programming Language Definition <https://techterms.com/definition/programming_language>`_ (``https://techterms.com/definition/programming_language``).

From now on, every concept treated in this appendix will refer strictly to their content with regards to C#. These concepts may not apply to other programming languages, which are not concerned in this manual.

  **Variables**
***************

What is a variable?
===================
A variable is simply a value with a mutable state, this means the user can change it before, during or after the execution of a workflow inside OpenRPA. A variable must also, obligatorily, have a type assigned to itself.

How do I declare a variable inside OpenRPA?
===========================================
Refer to section :ref:`Using the Designer` or section :ref:`Variables, Arguments`.

What types can a variable assume?
=================================
Virtually, any of the types compiled inside the OpenRPA application. If you want to take a peek into it, simply declare a variable and click ``Browse for types`` inside it.

 **Types**
**********

Now that we have properly defined hardware, software, and programming language, we can delve further into types.

What is a type?
===============
A type is the representation of a variable that a computer acts upon, or, putting it in layman terms, what the computer "sees".
