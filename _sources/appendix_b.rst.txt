Activities
==========

Click Element
-------------

Virtual Click
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A virtual click is different from a physical click in that it simulates a mouse event by using ``User32.dll``. There are several reasons to do this but the main ones are: it consumes less resources and provides a faster way of clicking an element. For more on the ``mouse_event`` function, please refer to `this link <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-mouse_event>`_ (``https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-mouse_event``).


Data Types
==========

DataView
--------
As per the `DataView Class page <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.dataview?view=netcore-3.1>`_  (``https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.dataview?view=netcore-3.1``), a ``DataView`` represents a databindable, customized view of a ``DataTable`` for sorting, filtering, searching, editing and navigation. It also does not store data, but instead represents a connected view of its corresponding ``DataTable``. Changes made to the ``DataView``'s data will affect the ``DataTAble``. Changes to the ``DataTable``'s data will affect all ``DataViews`` associated with it.

Filtering through a DataTable using DataView
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To filter through data inside a ``DataTable`` using a ``DataView``, first assign a variable of type ``System.Data.DataView`` to the ``DefaultView`` attribute of the ``DataTable`` you want to filter through. 

After that, assign to the ``RowFilter`` attribute of the ``DataView`` variable the filter you want to apply. In our case, we're using the ``"ID > 2``" to filter through all ``Int32`` values larger than 2 inside our ``DataTable``.

Then, just to make sure the ``DataView`` has actually filtered, we use a ``Foreach DataRow`` activity to output every row inside the ``DataView``. An example is shown below, with ``view`` as the ``DataView`` variable and ``dt`` as the ``DataTable`` variable.
